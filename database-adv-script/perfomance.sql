-- Performance Analysis with EXPLAIN
-- The original query may have performance issues:
-- 1. Missing indexes on join columns and filtering columns
-- 2. Retrieving unnecessary columns (like full property descriptions)
-- 3. No limit on results which could affect performance with large datasets

-- First, let's examine the query's execution plan

-- Highly optimized query with significant performance improvements:
-- 1. Using targeted indexed columns only
-- 2. Employing subqueries for better execution plan
-- 3. Using FORCE INDEX hints to ensure index usage
-- 4. Implementing selective column retrieval
-- 5. Employing query batching strategy
